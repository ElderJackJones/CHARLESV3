If you don't know what this code does, just forget about it. 

## Why JS?

JavaScript (or JS) is one of the only truly universal programming languages. It's easy to use and simple to read. For that reason I rewrote the Holly System into JavaScript.

## Why Not TypeScript?

...I have yet to learn TypeScript. I would love to, but I'm a missionary and don't have time for silly things like that.

## How do I...?

HA, nice try. If you're supposed to use this, you'll have received a document with instructions and videos for setup. 

## TODO

- [x] Set up basic framework
- [x] Create pseudo-human input for websites
- [x] Create a CLI to interact with Charles (this particular instance of Holly)
- [ ] Reformat ugly code
- [ ] Refactor fetching
- [ ] Wrap in electron.js interface?
- [ ] Make shareable across missions
- [ ] Increase efficiency
