If you don't know what this code does, just forget about it. 

## Why JS?

> JavaScript is the only language that I'm aware of that people feel they don't need to learn before they start using it. --Douglas Crockford

JavaScript (or JS) is one of the only truly universal programming languages. It's easy to use and simple to read. For that reason I rewrote the Holly System into JavaScript.

## Why Not TypeScript?

...I have yet to learn TypeScript. I would love to, but I'm a missionary and don't have time for silly things like that.

## How do I...?

HA, nice try. If you're supposed to use this, you'll have received a document with instructions and videos for setup.
